# Exercise 2

Create a class called "Datatypes". Within a main method in this class, declare and initialize variables of type byte, short, char, int, long, float, double, boolean, and print each variable to the console.

**Note: Remember that long values must be proceeded by the letter 'L', and float values must be proceeded by the letter 'F'. Additionally, character values must be within single quotation marks.
