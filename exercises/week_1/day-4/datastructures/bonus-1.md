For this exercise, create an executable class with a main method. Within this main method declare a reference variable for a Map object which accepts String values paired with other String values. Use the put method on this reference variable to add the following key and value pairs:

```java
"apple", "A forbidden fruit"
"banana", "A yellow fruit that can be peeled"
"cantaloupe", "A melon fruit that has an orange flesh"
```

Next, create a scanner object and ask for input from the user. Use the string input from the user to print the definitions from your dictionary based on the key that is received from the user. i.e. if the user types "apple" then the definition "A forbidden fruit", should print to the console.

**Note**: The `get` method of dictionaries can be used to retrieve the value based on the key provided.
