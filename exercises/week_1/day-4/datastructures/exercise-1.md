# Exercise 1

For this exercise, create an executable class with a main method. Within this main method declare a reference variable for a List Object which accepts String values. Initialize this value to a new ArrayList which accepts String values. Use the add method to add the following names to the collection: Jaque, Alex, Carrie, Ignacio, Byron, Gordon, Hazel, Max, Stephanie, Dev, Eric, Faith


**Note**: Generics use the angle-bracket notation and accept a Custom or built-in class. I.e.:
```java
List<Integer> 
```
