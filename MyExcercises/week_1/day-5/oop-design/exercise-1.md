# Exercise 1

For this exercise, create a Book Shelf that follows Object Oriented Programming Design principles. 

To guide you through this process, make sure that you have at least the following:

* An abstract Book superclass that defines the general structure of book objects
  * This superclass should contain parameterized constructors to initialize fields
* A 'Readable' interface that can be used to read any book, implemented by the Book class
* At least three classes that extend the Book superclass.
* Books should have at least the following fields:
  * bookText
  * name
  * author
* Make sure that your shelf has a collection that can contain different types of books


**BONUS: Allow users the functionality to select a subset of books from the shelf using the book name to find a single book or the author's name to find all written by that author.
