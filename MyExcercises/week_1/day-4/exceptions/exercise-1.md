# Exercise 1

For this exercise, create a class that extends the Exception class. Name the class "OddNumberException".

Create a separate, executable class with a main method. Within your executable class, create a method called "addEven". This method should declare two int parameters and include a throws declaration for OddNumberExceptions.

Within the method, check if either the first parameter or the second parameter are odd values. If any are odd, throw a new OddNumberException.
