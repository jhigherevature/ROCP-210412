/*
 *  The SIngleton design pattern is achieved by creating 
 *  a class with a method that will create an instance of
 *  an object ONLY when one does not already exist.
 *  Otherwise, the class will return a reference to the
 *  already existing object.
 *  
 *  There are a few ways we can implement the singleton
 *  design pattern; however a common trait for this
 *  pattern is to establish a private constructor and
 *  an overriden clone method(from the Object class)
